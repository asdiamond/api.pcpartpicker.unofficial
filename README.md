# pc-part-picker-api
An api to return pcparts as java objects from pcpartpicker.com . A personal project of mine, I am happy to help anyone who may use this.
As of now this api has the functionality of retrieving pcparts as java objects, serializing them into files and reading them out.
To use this repository I suggest importing the project into intelliJ, although it will work in anything else. The default intelliJ project
setting should be fine but be sure to keep the project structure the same. Be careful with importing Jsoup along with this project. If
you run into errors from not having jsoup, it may be best to create a libs directory of your own, downloading jsoup from https://jsoup.org/download
and adding it as a dependency manually.
